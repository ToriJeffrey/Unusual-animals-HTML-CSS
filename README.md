##Unusual Animals site

This is my first HTML project which includes CSS. I wanted to create something simple but I ended up spending a lot more time on this than I had anticipated. I was able to pick up the pace after the second fact card as I was able to reuse the code I had already written whilst making minor tweaks where needed. I've also tried to make the page somewhat responsive, however I think the text layout could be improved in a lot of areas.

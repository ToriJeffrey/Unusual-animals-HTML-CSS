                    <p>The lyrebird is a ground-dwelling bird native to Australia, known for its ability to mimic a wide variety of sounds from its environment, including other birds, mammals, and even mechanical sounds. There are two species of lyrebird: the Superb Lyrebird and the Albert's Lyrebird. They are most notable for the striking plumage of the males, which have long tail feathers that resemble a lyre (a type of harp). Both sexes have a distinctive brown plumage and a long tail. They are shy, elusive and generally hard to spot in wild but it is one of the most unique bird species on the planet.</p>

                    <p>The green basilisk lizard, also known as the plumed basilisk or the double crested basilisk, is a species of lizard found in Central and South America. It is known for its bright green coloration and the large crest of spiny scales that runs down its back, along with its ability to run across the surface of water by using its hind legs and tail. The green basilisk is an arboreal species, and it is also an excellent climber, able to run up and down trees quickly. The diet of the green basilisk typically includes insects, small invertebrates and some fruits.</p>

                    <p>The water deer is a small deer species native to China and Korea. It is one of the few species of deer in which the males have small, tusk-like canines protruding from their lower jaw, which they use in fights with other males during the breeding season. The water deer is a small and stocky animal, with a reddish-brown or grayish coat, and typically weighs around 50-70 lbs. They are semi aquatic, they are excellent swimmers and can be found near wetlands and rivers. They are herbivorous, eating a variety of grasses, aquatic plants, and fruits.</p>

                    <p>A pistol shrimp is a type of shrimp that is known for its unique hunting technique. It involves using its larger claw to make a popping sound by rapidly closing it which creates a cavitation bubble, which then implodes, the implosion generates temperatures of up to 8,000 degrees Fahrenheit and a shock wave of up to 62 decibels which is capable of killing small fish or invertebrates, and stunning larger animals.Pistol shrimps are typically small, growing to around 2-3 inches long and they are found in tropical and subtropical waters all over the world. </p>

                    <p>The Aye-aye is a lemur species native to Madagascar. It is known for its unusual combination of features, including its long, thin fingers and large ears. They are nocturnal and primarily feeds on insects, grubs and small vertebrates. They use their elongated middle finger to tap on branches and listen for the sound of insects. Once found they use their rodent-like teeth to gnaw through wood to reach its prey. They have large, round eyes that are adapted to see well in the dark, and large ears that can rotate to help them locate prey.

                    <p>A glass frog is a type of amphibian, known for their internal organs, bones, and blood vessels being visible through their skin. Their skin is an evolutionary adaption to aid them in blending in with their surroundings which makes them less visible to predators. Glass frogs are found in Central and South America, primarily in tropical rain-forests. They are quite small and typically measure around 1 to 2 inches in length. They are mostly found on leaves and branches near water sources, feeding on insects and spiders.</p>
